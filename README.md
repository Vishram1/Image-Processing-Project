# Image-Processing-Project

In this project I tried to address the issue of tampered images detection using two methods they are: 1) Trational Method (SIFT Keypoint based) and 2) Deep Learning method (RESNET 50) to extract key features and using a classifier to find out if its an forged image or not.
Please see the pdf reports for complete details.
