# Image-Processing-Project

In this project I tried to address the issue of tampered images detection using two methods they are: 1) Trational Method (SIFT Keypoint based) and 2) Deep Learning method (Inception Net) to extract key features and using a classifier to find out if its an forged image or not.
Please note that this is a group project and I'm only uploading my contibutions for the project.
Please see the pdf reports for complete details.
